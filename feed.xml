<h3 id="why-are-there-braces-but-no-semicolons-and-why-cant-i-put-the-opening-brace-on-the-next-line">Why are there braces but no semicolons? And why can&rsquo;t I put the opening brace on the next line?</h3>
<p>Go uses brace brackets for statement grouping, a syntax familiar to programmers who have worked with any language in the C family. Semicolons, however, are for parsers, not for people, and we wanted to eliminate them as much as possible. To achieve this goal, Go borrows a trick from BCPL: the semicolons that separate statements are in the formal grammar but are injected automatically, without lookahead, by the lexer at the end of any line that could be the end of a statement. This works very well in practice but has the effect that it forces a brace style. For instance, the opening brace of a function cannot appear on a line by itself.</p>
<p>Some have argued that the lexer should do lookahead to permit the brace to live on the next line. We disagree. Since Go code is meant to be formatted automatically by <code>[gofmt](https://go.dev/cmd/gofmt/)</code>, <em>some</em> style must be chosen. That style may differ from what you&rsquo;ve used in C or Java, but Go is a different language and <code>gofmt</code>&rsquo;s style is as good as any other. More important—much more important—the advantages of a single, programmatically mandated format for all Go programs greatly outweigh any perceived disadvantages of the particular style. Note too that Go&rsquo;s style means that an interactive implementation of Go can use the standard syntax one line at a time without special rules.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-variable-in-general">What is a variable in general?</h2>
<p>A variable in programming is a data, that changes depending on certaing things, so certainly a variable will be stored in memory during certain cycle.</p>
<p>For example if we register a user, his name is a variable, we call name, and the value assigned to it, is his name.</p>
<p>Each user will have different name obviously, so that varies.</p>
<h2 id="why-data-type-exists">Why data type exists?</h2>
<p>So all users have names. and the name has a type of characters. so a name is sequence of letters, John, Jane or Johny ..ect however he unlikely has a name of 007 right.</p>
<p>An age however, is generally a sequence of digits  4, 18, 67 years old.</p>
<p>This lead us to understand, age is integer, and name is a string. there is some other types.</p>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>
<p>Our software will hold plenty of variables of so many types, however we often use them in certain level, or scope. you dont want the variables hanging, accessible and editable everywhere. thats why in programming often, the variables has a scope declaration, which dictates the boundaries of this particular variable. (private, public, global..ect)</p>
<aside>
💡 Off Go topic but in programming in general
- We need a combination of freedom to do things, but certain rules help us stay consice. in a way we have helpful restrictions.
- Imagine we have cars, but we don’t have a law of traffic, then you can drive in any direction at any speed in any manner, how horrible driving a car experience will be?
I am sure you would still manage to move from A to be B eventually but how if we have certain rules to keep you safe.
- Each programming language or framework will try to keep you safe in its way, and there is further arbitrary things you or your tech leder will decide upon.

<h2 id="how-to-declare-a-variable-in-go">How to declare a variable in Go</h2>
<p>To declare a variable in Golang, there is 3 ways of declarations, one thing to consider is that always a variable will have a predefined type, otherwise our compiler will yell at us.</p>
<p>The declaration will be a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keyword var, which stands for variable obviously.</li>
<li>An arbitrary name (ex: i, age, phoneNumber).</li>
<li>Variable type which can be String, Integer, Float..ect or we can let the compiler detect the type at compile time.</li>
<li>Optionally we can initiliase the variable instantly, or sometimes we declare a variable, differently from initialising it. (bear in mind, every variable has to be used).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a variable declaration.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">name</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&#34;John&#34;</span>

💡 Var keyword refers to variables in Golang
</aside>
<h2 id="golang-print-a-variable">Golang print a variable</h2>
<p>Golang has variety of ways and functions to print a variable, but for our learning purposes we will see two ways, using the FMT package, or the built in function</p>
<p>We can use <code>println</code> function from the built in functions, to print variables in a single line, or we can use the package FMT, which provides many other tools including printing the value within a string, or getting the type to see what we are working with.</p>

<ul>
<li>We deal with user inputs</li>
<li>Manually manipulate the binary data (pointers)</li>

<h2 id="data-type-declaration">Data type declaration</h2>

💡 Quotes is how to write a string in Golang. so Go knows its not a keyword we want to use or a function..ect
For example 42, and “42” dosent mean the same thing, the first one is for integers, and the second one is for strings.

<p>There is two rules of thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naming convention controls the visibility, the first letter of variable defines wether its global or local, lower case first letter (aka camel case) are scoped to the package they are declared in, Upper case first letter (aka Pascale case) exposes the variable to the outside scope they become global. The three levels of visibility in Golang
<ul>
<li>Package level scope if its lower case, so any file under the same package can access the variable,</li>
<li>If its upper case in the package, it becomes globally visible</li>
<li>Block scope so if its in a loop or a function..ect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The name of the variable is affected by the lifespan of the variable, if its going to be used for long then be as descriptive as possible, but dont go over 50 letters or so, However if you just need it where you will use it, then feel free to minimize the length.</li>
<li>When you use acronyms, like HTTP, or URL URI..ect keep those all upper case.</li>

<h3 id="what-about-not-using-a-variable-in-its-declaration-block">What about not using a variable in its declaration block?</h3>
<p>Golang complier, obliges us to use the variables, otherwise we would be yelled at.
So bear in mind that whenever you declare a variable you have to use it in its scope, or the interscopes, otherwise the complier will complain.</p>
<p>This is pretty valuable to keep our code concise and get rid of junk or unused code</p>
