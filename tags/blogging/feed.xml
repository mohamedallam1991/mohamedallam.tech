But are there alternatives? What are they and how do they work?.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="analytics-tools-google-analytics-vs-the-world">Analytics tools Google analytics vs the world</h1>
<p>Google Analytics can help you gain a great deal of insight into your Internet website, and its insights and information can help you make more informed marketing choices. However, if you&rsquo;re not a fan of the analytics tool or its features, there are numerous other choices available.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-website-analytics">What are website analytics?</h2>
<p>2005 ushered in a new era as more businesses turned to analytics tools, collecting data to help with their decision-making. Along with that came concerns regarding data storage, ownership and privacy. So tools started their journey</p>
<p>Website analytics tools allow website owners and developers to track the performance of their websites on a regular basis. In addition to measuring the number of visitors, pageviews, and unique users, these tools can also measure how much time site visitors spend on each page, what keywords are being used to find the site, and what marketing channels are being used to promote it.</p>
<p>Analytics tools also allow website owners to measure the effectiveness of their advertising efforts, and can offer suggestions for where to spend additional marketing funds.</p>
<p>Which is known as: Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a method.</p>
<p>to increase the visibility of a website and its content in search engine results. It can be achieved through implementing certain keywords into web pages and creating broken links to pages that are relevant to those keywords.</p>
<h2 id="market-share">Market share</h2>
<p>35.2% of the websites use none of the traffic analysis tools that we monitor.</p>
<p>Google Analytics is used by 55.6% of all the websites, that is a traffic analysis tool market share of 85.9%.</p>

<h2 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by the giant: Google. It helps website owners understand how people are using their websites, what interests them, and how they can improve their website. By tracking the activities of website visitors, you can learn what content is most popular and which areas need more attention.</p>
<p>Google analytics is cool, but its not fast and it has some other issues, lets reconsider:</p>
<h2 id="paid">Paid</h2>
<p>We can find many other alternatives that paid, each has a unique selling proportion:</p>
<h3 id="heap">Heap</h3>
<p>Heap analyzes your complete dataset to quickly illuminate hidden insights so you can act with confidence. With Heap you can see and understand every single thing your users do.</p>
<h3 id="gauges">Gauges</h3>
<p>Real web analytics, Gauges is updated live as each view comes in. You never evenhave to refresh the dashboard. No more waiting for today’s metrics.</p>
<h3 id="fathom">Fathom</h3>
<p><strong>Fathom is a Google Analytics alternative that doesn’t compromise visitor privacy for data,</strong> We revolutionized website analytics by making them easy to use and respectful of privacy laws (like GDPR and more).</p>
<h2 id="free-and-open-source-software-foss">Free and Open source Software (FOSS)</h2>
<p>Many site owners have the habit of installing the Google Analytics tracking script on their sites as one of the first actions they take after the launch.</p>
<p>Here’s why you should break the habit of using Google Analytics and consider FOSS.</p>
<p>Open source software is software that is made available to the public for free so that people can see and change it. This way, anyone can make changes to the code, and the software can be improved over time as more people use it. Open source software is often used in place of expensive, proprietary software.</p>
<p>And as google dosen’t open source the tools, it actually gathers the data for other use purposes, so the data are the currency.</p>
<p>It’s 2022, big firms like <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2021/11/10/google-loses-appeal-against-2-4-billion-eu-fine-over-its-shopping-service">Google</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/acm-apple-fine/">Apple</a> are suffering, so it’s big time to look after your privacy. Open Source obviously protects privacy out of the box.</p>
<p>So here is a break down of the most popular open source analytics tools, which offer roughly the same functionality.</p>
<p>Some free open source tools:</p>
<h3 id="matomo">Matomo</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mikecao/umami">https://github.com/mikecao/umami</a></p>
<h2 id="case-study">Case study</h2>
<p>Google analytics is blocked by so many web browsers, or adblocks, which gives using other alternatives a boost, also the self hosted ones most likely can have the script edited. to comply with any block. particularly when knowing this alternatives are this small.</p>
<p>As I have a <a href="http://laravelexample.com">Hashnode</a> blog, with both Google analytics and Plausible, we can actually see the difference and how inaccurate Google is. this results are from the 1st January 2022, to today 28 May 2022</p>
